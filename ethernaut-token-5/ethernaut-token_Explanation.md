In Ethernaut Token Challenge 5, you are given 20 tokens to start with, and your objective is to acquire additional tokens, preferably a very large amount.

The vulnerability in this contract lies in the lack of proper handling of integer underflows and overflows. When a uint (unsigned integer) reaches its byte size, an overflow occurs, and the next element added will wrap around to the first variable element. Conversely, an underflow happens when a uint8, for example, is zero, and you subtract one from it, resulting in 255.

The issue occurs in the lines `require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0)` and `balances[msg.sender] -= _value`. To exploit this, transfer 21 tokens to another address, causing an underflow and setting your balance to a very large number.

To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker can transfer 21 tokens (more than the initial 20) to another address. This will cause an underflow, setting the balance to a very large number.

To prevent underflows and overflows in Solidity, there are two options:

1. Use OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library, which automatically checks for overflows and underflows in all mathematical operators.
2. Use Solidity version 0.8 or later, which includes built-in overflow and underflow checks that cause a revert if they occur.
